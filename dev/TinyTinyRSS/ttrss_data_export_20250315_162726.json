            "content": "HPC-AI Tech researchers introduce Open-Sora 2.0, a commercial-level AI video generation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing training costs. This model was developed with an investment of only $200,000, making it five to ten times more cost-efficient than competing models such as MovieGen and Step-Video-T2V. Open-Sora 2.0 is designed to democratize AI video generation by making high-performance technology accessible to a wider audience. Unlike previous high-cost models, this approach integrates multiple efficiency-driven innovations, including improved data curation, an advanced autoencoder, a novel hybrid transformer framework, and highly optimized training methodologies.\n\n \n\nThe research team implemented a hierarchical data filtering system that refines video datasets into progressively higher-quality subsets, ensuring optimal training efficiency. A significant breakthrough was the introduction of the Video DC-AE autoencoder, which improves video compression while reducing the number of tokens required for representation. The model’s architecture incorporates full attention mechanisms, multi-stream processing, and a hybrid diffusion transformer approach to enhance video quality and motion accuracy. Training efficiency was maximized through a three-stage pipeline: text-to-video learning on low-resolution data, image-to-video adaptation for improved motion dynamics, and high-resolution fine-tuning. This structured approach allows the model to understand complex motion patterns and spatial consistency while maintaining computational efficiency.......\n\n \n\nRead full article here: https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/03/14/hpc-ai-tech-releases-open-sora-2-0-an-open-source-sota-level-video-generation-model-trained-for-just-200k/\n\n \n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09642v1\n\n \n\nGitHub Page: https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-Sora?tab=readme-ov-file\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ocv0dyo4bsoe1.png?width=2813&format=png&auto=webp&s=474a5ecdfe80c5fc625dbce68de9b0d492f79d0e\n\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

            "content": "Cornell Tech and Stanford University researchers introduced **Block Discrete Denoising Diffusion Language Models (BD3-LMs)** to overcome these limitations. This new class of models interpolates between autoregressive and diffusion models by employing a structured approach that supports variable-length generation while maintaining inference efficiency. BD3-LMs use key-value caching and parallel token sampling to reduce computational overhead. The model is designed with specialized training algorithms that minimize gradient variance through customized noise schedules, optimizing performance across diverse language modeling benchmarks.\n\n \n\nBD3-LMs operate by structuring text generation into blocks rather than individual tokens. Unlike traditional autoregressive models, which predict the next token sequentially, BD3-LMs generate a block of tokens simultaneously, significantly improving efficiency. A diffusion-based denoising process within each block ensures high-quality text generation while preserving coherence. The model architecture integrates transformers with a block-causal attention mechanism, allowing each block to condition on previously generated blocks. This approach enhances both contextual relevance and fluency. The training process includes a vectorized implementation that enables parallel computations, reducing training time and resource consumption. Researchers introduced data-driven noise schedules that stabilize training and improve gradient estimation to address the high variance issue in diffusion models.......\n\n \n\nRead full article: https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/03/14/this-ai-paper-introduces-bd3-lms-a-hybrid-approach-combining-autoregressive-and-diffusion-models-for-scalable-and-efficient-text-generation/\n\n \n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09573\n\n \n\nGitHub Page: https://github.com/kuleshov-group/bd3lms\n\n \n\nProject: https://m-arriola.com/bd3lms/\n\n \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/d8g3ugnt1qoe1.gif\n\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

            "content": "Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University & Hugging Face investigate optimizing test-time compute for LLMs by refining how models allocate computational resources during reasoning. Instead of relying solely on outcome-reward RL, they introduce a fine-tuning approach that balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring steady progress toward correct answers. Their method incorporates a dense reward bonus to quantify progress, improving efficiency. Evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms existing methods, enhancing both accuracy and token efficiency. Their findings also suggest that optimizing for progress minimizes computational regret while improving solution discovery without sacrificing accuracy.\n\n \n\nThe problem of optimizing test-time compute is framed as a meta reinforcement learning (meta RL) challenge. The goal is to maximize an LLM’s performance within a given test-time token budget by balancing exploration and exploitation. Instead of solely optimizing for outcomes, the proposed Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MRT) approach minimizes cumulative regret by rewarding progress across sequential episodes. This budget-agnostic strategy allows LLMs to make steady progress regardless of training constraints. By incorporating a reward bonus based on incremental improvements, MRT ensures efficient test-time compute usage, enhancing adaptability and response accuracy within deployment constraints......\n\n \n\nRead full article: https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/03/14/optimizing-test-time-compute-for-llms-a-meta-reinforcement-learning-approach-with-cumulative-regret-minimization/\n\n \n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07572\n\n \n\nCode: https://github.com/CMU-AIRe/MRT\n\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

            "content": "Alibaba Researchers present R1-Omni, an application of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) to an omni-multimodal large language model tailored for emotion recognition. R1-Omni builds on the established HumanOmni framework and applies RLVR to fine-tune the model for handling both video and audio data. The method begins with a cold start phase, where the model is pre-trained using a combined dataset from Explainable Multimodal Emotion Reasoning (EMER) and a manually annotated dataset. This initial training helps the model learn basic reasoning skills before being refined with RLVR. By integrating a rule-based reward mechanism into the training process, R1-Omni is optimized not only for accurate emotion prediction but also for generating clear and interpretable explanations that describe how visual and auditory information interact.\n\n \n\nAt the core of R1-Omni’s design is the integration of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). RLVR replaces the need for subjective human feedback with a verifiable reward function that assesses the model’s output against objective criteria. The reward system is straightforward: if the model’s emotion prediction matches the ground truth, it receives a reward of 1; otherwise, it receives 0. Additionally, a format reward ensures that the output adheres to a specified structure, where the reasoning process is clearly separated from the final prediction by designated tags.......\n\n \n\nRead full article: https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/03/12/alibaba-researchers-introduce-r1-omni-an-application-of-reinforcement-learning-with-verifiable-reward-rlvr-to-an-omni-multimodal-large-language-model/\n\n \n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05379\n\n \n\nGitHub Page: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/R1-Omni\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/apwkz061xdoe1.png?width=1744&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c6287ae45fab81686d25fa556441fa1767d11ee\n\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

First, it masters data distribution using unlabeled data via an unsupervised diffusion model, avoiding the semantic ambiguity common in semi-supervised methods. Second, it implements controllable fine-tuning on text-labeled data without expanding the training dataset. Instead, Text2Data employs a constraint optimization-based learning objective that prevents catastrophic forgetting by keeping model parameters close to their pre-fine-tuning state. This unique framework effectively utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data to maintain fine-grained data distribution while achieving superior controllability. Theoretical validation supports the optimization constraint selection and generalization bounds, with comprehensive experiments across three modalities demonstrating Text2Data’s superior generation quality and controllability compared to baseline methods......\n\n \n\nRead full article: https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/03/09/salesforce-ai-releases-text2data-a-training-framework-for-low-resource-data-generation/\n\n \n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10941\n\n \n\nGithub Page: https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/text2data\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6wlo3jj60tne1.png?width=2022&format=png&auto=webp&s=26dfeddfb0803173652c935a176fb4beaf8624ce\n\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

            "content": "Google researchers introduced Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA), which applies differentiable logic gates to cellular automata. This method successfully replicates the rules of Conway’s Game of Life and generates patterns through learned discrete dynamics. The approach merges Neural Cellular Automata (NCA), which can learn arbitrary behaviors but lack discrete state constraints, with Differentiable Logic Gate Networks, which enable combinatorial logic discovery but have not been tested in recurrent settings. This integration paves the way for learnable, local, and discrete computing, potentially advancing programmable matter. The study explores whether Differentiable Logic CA can learn and generate complex patterns akin to traditional NCAs.\n\n \n\nNCA integrates classical cellular automata with deep learning, enabling self-organization through learnable update rules. Unlike traditional methods, NCA uses gradient descent to discover dynamic interactions while preserving locality and parallelism. A 2D grid of cells evolves via perception (using Sobel filters) and update stages (through neural networks). Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) extend this by replacing neurons with logic gates, allowing discrete operations to be learned via continuous relaxations. DiffLogic CA further integrates these concepts, employing binary-state cells with logic gate-based perception and update mechanisms, forming an adaptable computational system akin to programmable matter architectures like CAM-8........\n\n \n\nRead full article: https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/03/09/google-ai-introduces-differentiable-logic-cellular-automata-difflogic-ca-a-differentiable-logic-approach-to-neural-cellular-automata/\n\n \n\nTechnical details: https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/?hn\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ng575l3t2qne1.png?width=1372&format=png&auto=webp&s=c542d9ba66aca22099bd01c2862a39809002b2e3\n\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

            "content": "Researchers from Microsoft Research Asia, Ubiquant, and Independent have proposed Logic-RL, a rule-based RL framework that acquires reasoning patterns similar to DeepSeek-R1 through training on logic puzzles. It adopts the REINFORCE++ algorithm and reward designs from DeepSeek-R1 for post-training. As training progresses, the model naturally allocates more computational steps to reasoning, expanding from generating hundreds to thousands of tokens, which enables deeper exploration and refinement of thought processes. Using only 5K generated logic puzzles, their 7B model shows cross-domain generalization, improving by 125% on AIME and 38% on AMC against the base model. This suggests that RL-trained reasoning develops abstract problem-solving patterns rather than domain-specific matching.\n\n \n\nThe researchers face challenges with Qwen2.5-Math-7B’s tendency to generate Python code blocks that conflict with formatting requirements. Testing both Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct reveals nearly identical training metrics during RL training, including validation accuracy, response length growth curves, and reward curves. The implementation shows dramatic improvements in reasoning capabilities, with output length increasing from an initial average of 500 tokens to approximately 2000 tokens after just 1000 RL training steps. This enables the emergence of more complex behaviors, such as reflection and exploration of alternative solutions, and these behaviors significantly enhance the model’s ability to handle complex tasks and are closely aligned with the results reported in DeepSeek-R1......\n\n \n\nRead full article: https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/03/08/microsoft-and-ubiquant-researchers-introduce-logic-rl-a-rule-based-reinforcement-learning-framework-that-acquires-r1-like-reasoning-patterns-through-training-on-logic-puzzles/\n\n \n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14768\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b3he1v212mne1.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=831c34ee3c4150e4f926976ec033ac20913ffbb8\n\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

Rather than relying on traditional training data, PAPRIKA leverages synthetic interaction data generated across a diverse set of tasks. These tasks range from classic guessing games like twenty questions to puzzles such as Mastermind and even scenarios simulating customer service interactions. By training on these varied trajectories, the model learns to adjust its behavior based on contextual feedback from its environment—without the need for additional gradient updates. This approach encourages the model to adopt a more flexible, in-context learning strategy that can be applied to a range of new tasks.\n\n \n\nPAPRIKA’s methodology is built on a two-stage fine-tuning process. The first stage involves exposing the LLM to a large set of synthetic trajectories generated using a method called Min‑p sampling, which ensures that the training data is both diverse and coherent. This step allows the model to experience a wide spectrum of interaction strategies, including both successful and less effective decision-making behaviors. The second stage refines the model using a blend of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and a direct preference optimization (DPO) objective.
