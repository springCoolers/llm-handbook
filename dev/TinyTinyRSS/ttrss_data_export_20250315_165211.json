            "link": "https://dev.to/kamleshj/understanding-package-name-categories-tags-in-google-play-console-a-complete-guide-46j1",
            "content": "When publishing an app on the Google Play Store, understanding the package name, categories, and tags is crucial. These elements help in uniquely identifying your app, improving discoverability, and ensuring a seamless Play Store experience.\n\nIn this guide, we'll explore:\n\n ✔️ What is a Package Name and why is it important?\n\n ✔️ How to select the right category and tags for your app?\n\n ✔️ Step-by-step guide to setting them up in Google Play Console\n\nLet's dive in! 🚀\n\n🎯 What is a Package Name?\n\nJust like every house has a unique address, every Android app has a unique package name. This ensures no two apps on the Play Store have the same identity.\n\nA package name is an application ID assigned to an Android app when it is developed. It is essential for distinguishing the app from others on the Google Play Store and within a device's system.\n\n📌 Important: Once an app is published on the Play Store, the package name cannot be changed.\n\n📌 Format of a Package Name\n\nA package name follows a reverse domain naming convention. The general format is:\n\ncom.companyname.appname\n\n🔹 com → Top-level domain (can be .org, .net, etc.)\n\n 🔹 companyname → Your company or organization's name\n\n 🔹 appname → The specific app identifier\n\n📌 Real-World Examples\n\nWhatsApp → com.whatsapp\n\nFacebook → com.facebook.katana\n\nInstagram → com.instagram.android\n\n👉 Example for a company: If your company is mycompany.com, and your app is TravelGuide, the package name could be: \n\ncom.mycompany.travelguide\n\n🔥 Importance of a Package Name\n\n✅ 1. Uniqueness\n\nEvery app must have a unique package name, preventing conflicts during installation.\n\n✅ 2. Play Store Identification\n\nWhen an app is uploaded to the Google Play Console, its package name acts as a permanent identifier.\n\n 🔗 Example: Play Store link for WhatsApp →\n\n https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp\n\n✅ 3. App Updates & Version Control\n\n🔄 Android checks the package name to determine whether an update should replace an existing app.\n\n💡 iOS Equivalent: Unlike Google Play, Apple's App Store uses a bundle identifier instead of a package name.\n\n🚫 Can You Change a Package Name?\n\nNo! Once an app is published, the package name cannot be changed.\n\nIf you need a new package name, you must upload it as a new app, which means losing:\n\n ✔️ Downloads\n\n ✔️ Reviews\n\n ✔️ Rankings\n\n📌 Best Practice for Large Projects\n\nFor multi-module apps, developers use structured sub-packages:\n\ncom.mycompany.travelguide.ui → (For UI components)\n\ncom.mycompany.travelguide.db → (For database-related code)\n\ncom.mycompany.travelguide.utils → (For utility functions)\n\n📌 Understanding Categories & Tags in Google Play Console\n\n📍 What is a Category?\n\nA category defines the primary type of your app. It helps users find apps based on their interests. Google provides 30+ predefined categories for apps on the Play Store.\n\n📍 What are Tags?\n\nTags are keywords that help users discover your app.\n\n📌 Difference:\n\n ✔️ Categories → Defines the main type of your app\n\n ✔️ Tags → Help with searchability\n\n📌 Example:\n\n For a multiplayer racing game with vintage cars, relevant tags could be:\n\n ✅ \"Racing\"\n\n ✅ \"Car racing\"\n\n🚫 It should not have irrelevant tags like \"Stunt driving\", as it doesn't match the app's content.\n\n🔥 How Tags Affect App Ranking & Visibility\n\nThere are two main ways an app can be discovered in the Play Store:\n\n ✔️ Search (when users type keywords in the search bar)\n\n ✔️ Explore/Browse (when users scroll through categories)\n\n🔎 Example:\n\nA user searching for \"kids games\" or \"puzzle\" will see apps with relevant tags displayed in the search results.\n\n📌 Choosing the wrong tags may:\n\n ❌ Make your app show up in the wrong category\n\n ❌ Reduce visibility compared to competitors\n\n🛠️ How to Add Tags in Google Play Console?\n\nAdding tags is simple! Follow these steps:\n\n1️⃣ Open Play Console\n\n2️⃣ Select your app\n\n3️⃣ On the left menu, go to Grow > Store presence > Store settings\n\n4️⃣ Under App Category, select:\n\n  ✅ Application type\n\n  ✅ Category\n\n5️⃣ Click Manage tags to start adding relevant tags\n\n6️⃣ Choose from Suggested tags or search for Other tags\n\n7️⃣ Click Save 🎯\n\n✅ Conclusion\n\n📌 Package Name: A unique app identifier that cannot be changed after publishing.\n\n 📌 Categories: Helps users find apps based on their interests.\n\n 📌 Tags: Improve search visibility and ranking on Google Play.\n\n🚀 By carefully choosing the right package name, category, and tags, you can ensure your app reaches the right audience and performs better in search rankings!\n\n💬 Got any questions? Drop them in the comments! 😊\n\n📢 Follow for More Google Play Console Tips!\n\n👉 If you found this guide helpful, share it and follow me for more app publishing insights! 🚀",

            "link": "https://dev.to/nda_27/how-to-be-test-driven-with-spark-chapter-5-leverage-spark-in-a-container-1p74",
            "content": "This goal of this tutorial is to provide a way to easily be test driven with spark on your local setup without using cloud resources.\n\nThis is a series of tutorials and the initial chapters can be found in:\n\n- Chapter 0 and 1\n\n- Chapter 2\n\n- Chapter 3\n\n- Chapter 4\n\nIn chapter 3, it was demonstrated that the current testing approach rely on *Java* being available on the developer setup. As mentioned, this is not ideal as there is limited control and unexpected behavior can happen. A good testing practice is to have reproducible and idempotent tests, this means:\n\n- Launching the tests an infinite number of times should always have the same results\n\n- A test should leave a clean plate after it has run, there should be no side effect to a test running (no files written, no change of environment variables, no database with remaining data etc)\n\nThe reasons why it's so important, is because otherwise you will spend most of your time relaunching the tests due to false positive, you would never be sure if you actually broke something or if the test is randomly failing. At the end, you will not trust the tests anymore and skip some of them, which defeats the purpose.\n\n  \n  \n  Why using a container?\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with the concept of containers and docker images, I suggest you have a look at docker. It will be leveraged here to start the *Spark* server for the tests; it's important to mention there are other opensource alternatives like podman or nerdctl to allow containerization.\n\nDocker will be used thereafter as it has become the defacto standards for most companies, and it's available in the *Github* ci runner. It will be assumed that you have enough knowledge about the technology to use it.\n\n  \n  \n  Container with spark connect\n\nThere is a small subtlety that needs to be understood. Previously, the *Java Virtual Machine (JVM)* was used to communicate with the python spark implementation (through the spark_session), it was using the java binary to create a swarm of workers that were handling the data processing. At the end, all the results were collected and communicated to the spark_session which was exposing it in the python code.\n\nIf you start a container with this, the spark_session will never be able to find the *JVM* inside the container as it's a binary. The container you want to create needs a way to communicate outside with the spark_session through the network. Luckily, *Spark* connect is providing a solution and the documentation is a must known. This is the chosen approach to containerize the *Spark* server and the worker creation.\n\n*Spark* is already providing a docker image that you will leverage. If you don't have docker available on your setup, you will need to install it, see the official documentation.\n\nLet's uninstall openjdk to make sure spark_session will use the new setup, it will require elevation of privileges:\n\n```\napt-get autoremove openjdk-8-jre\n\n```\n\nYou can now relaunch the tests, it's expected that they fail with the following error:\n\n```\nERROR tests/test_minimal_transfo.py::test_minimal_transfo - pyspark.errors.exceptions.base.PySparkRuntimeError: [JAVA_GATEWAY_EXITED] Java gateway process exited before sending its port number.\nERROR tests/test_minimal_transfo.py::test_transfo_w_synthetic_data - pyspark.errors.exceptions.base.PySparkRuntimeError: [JAVA_GATEWAY_EXITED] Java gateway process exited before sending its port number.\n\n```\n\n  \n  \n  Start the container\n\nYou will need to start the container with spark connect, you can launch\n\n```\ndocker run <span class=\"nt\">-p</span> 8081:8081 <span class=\"nt\">-e</span> <span class=\"nv\">SPARK_NO_DAEMONIZE</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>True <span class=\"nt\">--name</span> spark_connect apache/spark /opt/spark/sbin/start-connect-server.sh org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master <span class=\"nt\">--packages</span> org.apache.spark:spark-connect_2.12:3.5.2,io.delta:delta-core_2.12:2.3.0 <span class=\"nt\">--conf</span> spark.driver.extraJavaOptions<span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s1\">'-Divy.cache.dir=/tmp -Divy.home=/tmp'</span> <span class=\"nt\">--conf</span> spark.connect.grpc.binding.port<span class=\"o\">=</span>8081\n\n```\n\nIt will print a lot in the terminal and at the end you should have:\n\n```\n24/12/27 14:04:27 INFO SparkConnectServer: Spark Connect server started at: 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0%0:8081\n\n```\n\nThis shows that the *Spark* server is up and running.\n\nEach argument in the above command has a meaning and its importance:\n\n- \ndocker run is the docker command to start a container\n\n- \n-p 8081:8081 is an arguments to docker run that enables to use port 8081 to communicate with the created container\n\n- \n-e SPARK_NO_DAEMONIZE=True is an environment variable that is passed to the container creation, it's necessary to use it for the server to be created as a foreground process\n\n- \n--name spark_connect allows to name the created container\n\n- \napache/spark is the docker image that is used, if you never used it, it will be downloaded from *Docker Hub*\n\nThe rest of the command is what is called an entrypoint, it's the command that will be executed inside the container. In here it contains multiple elements:\n\n- \n/opt/spark/sbin/start-connect-server.sh is the binary of the spark server\n\n- \norg.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master is an argument to the binary, in here the binary is asked to deploy a Master server, the same binary can be used to deploy a Worker\n\n- \n--packages org.apache.spark:spark-connect_2.12:3.5.2,io.delta:delta-core_2.12:2.3.0 is an optional argument to pass specific versions of spark, and delta dependencies\n\n- \n--conf spark.driver.extraJavaOptions='-Divy.cache.dir=/tmp -Divy.home=/tmp' is extra argument to ask the server to write to /tmp inside the container, it's not a mandatory argument\n\n- \n--conf spark.connect.grpc.binding.port=8081 is an extra argument to start the server on the port 8081 on the localhost of the container\n\nThe last argument is where the magic happens, the server is started on port 8081, and docker is exposing the port of this container to the port of the docker host. Meaning, a spark server is now available on http://localhost:8081\n\n  \n  \n  Use the container\n\nKeep the previous terminal opened to keep the server running and open a new terminal. Now run:\n\n```\npytest <span class=\"nt\">-k</span> test_transfo_w_synthetic_data <span class=\"nt\">-s</span>\n\n```\n\nThe same error should appear, indeed the spark_session needs to be adapted to connect to the server you have just created. In test/conftest.py:\n\n```\n<span class=\"nd\">@pytest.fixture</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">scope</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">session</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">spark_session</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">-></span> <span class=\"n\">Generator</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">SparkSession</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">Any</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">Any</span><span class=\"p\">]:</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">yield </span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">SparkSession</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">builder</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">remote</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">sc://localhost:8081</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># type: ignore\n</span>        <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">appName</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">Testing PySpark Example</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">getOrCreate</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n```\n\nBasically, it indicates the *Spark* connect server *url* to the *Spark* session.\n\nAnd you need to add an extra dependency, which is mandatory to communicate with the spark connect server. It's worth pointing to the usage of extras in uv:\n\n```\nuv add pyspark <span class=\"nt\">--extra</span> connect\n\n```\n\nAs this project is in *Python* 3.12, another error will appear related to distutils as it was removed from the latest python version, yet some dependencies still requires it. You will have to add:\n\n```\nuv add setuptools\n\n```\n\nNow you can run:\n\n```\npytest <span class=\"nt\">-k</span> test_minimal_transfo <span class=\"nt\">-s</span>\n\n```\n\nAnd it should run successfully, you should also see logs in the spark server in the docker run terminal.\n\n  \n  \n  Improve the container usage\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, the tests need to leave a clean plate. In the previous approach, a container is still running eventhough the tests are done, it's not ideal.\n\nTo improve this, you will leverage testcontainers which empower you with easy docker creation and removal at the test level.\n\n```\nuv add testcontainers <span class=\"nt\">--dev</span>\n\n```\n\nNow, the docker can be started at the session fixture level, in tests/conftest.py, you can add an extra fixture:\n\n```\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">testcontainers.core.container</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">DockerContainer</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">testcontainers.core.waiting_utils</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">wait_for_logs</span>\n\n<span class=\"nd\">@pytest.fixture</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">scope</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">session</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">spark_connect_start</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">kwargs</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">entrypoint</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">/opt/spark/sbin/start-connect-server.sh org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master --packages org.apache.spark:spark-connect_2.12:3.5.2,io.delta:delta-core_2.12:2.3.0 --conf spark.driver.extraJavaOptions=</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">-Divy.cache.dir=/tmp -Divy.home=/tmp</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\"> --conf spark.connect.grpc.binding.port=8081</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">with </span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n        <span class=\"nc\">DockerContainer</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n            <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">apache/spark</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">with_bind_ports</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">8081</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">8081</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">with_env</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">SPARK_NO_DAEMONIZE</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">True</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">with_kwargs</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">**</span><span class=\"n\">kwargs</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"n\">container</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">_</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">wait_for_logs</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">container</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">SparkConnectServer: Spark Connect server started at</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">yield</span> <span class=\"n\">container</span>\n\n```\n\nThis will create a container with the previously described argument, the great thing with fixtures is that will kill the container at the end of the test execution. There is an extra step with:\n\n```\n        <span class=\"n\">_</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">wait_for_logs</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">container</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">SparkConnectServer: Spark Connect server started at</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n```\n\nThis enforces to yield the container only when the SparkConnectServer: Spark Connect server started at appeared in the container logs. It's necessary to wait for the server to be ready until it can be called.\n\nThe value that is yielded is the container which also contains the server url, you need to reuse in the spark_session fixture:\n\n```\n<span class=\"nd\">@pytest.fixture</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">scope</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">session</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">spark_session</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">spark_connect_start</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">DockerContainer</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">-></span> <span class=\"n\">Generator</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">SparkSession</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">Any</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">Any</span><span class=\"p\">]:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">ip</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">spark_connect_start</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">get_container_host_ip</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">yield </span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">SparkSession</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">builder</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">remote</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sa\">f</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">sc://</span><span class=\"si\">{</span><span class=\"n\">ip</span><span class=\"si\">}</span><span class=\"s\">:8081</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># type: ignore\n</span>        <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">appName</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">Testing PySpark Example</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">getOrCreate</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n```\n\nYou can now stop the container you started before\n\n```\ndocker stop spark_connect\n\n```\n\nAnd run the tests:\n\n```\npytest\n\n```\n\nYou will notice all the tests are passing, and at the end of the test session there is no running containers.\n\nThe following command will show what remaining containers are still running. The spark container should not appear.\n\n```\ndocker ps <span class=\"nt\">-a</span> \n\n```\n\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n\nYou are now able to run local tests using spark and you can quickly iterate on your codebase and implement new features. You are no more depending on spark server to be launched for you on the cloud and waiting for it to process the data for you.\n\nThe feedback loop is quicker, you are no more giving money to cloud provider for testing purposes and you provide an easy setup for developers to iterate on your project.\n\nThey can launch pytest and will be transparent; this also means less documentation for you to write to describe the expected developer setup.\n\nYou can find the original materials in spark_tdd.

It tells Spring to manage an instance of the object and inject it wherever needed.\n\n**🔹 Example 1: Basic @bean Usage**\n\n✔ Scenario: You want to create and manage a HelloService bean manually instead of using @Component.\n\n🚀 Implementation\n\nStep 1: Create a Service Class\n\n```\npublic class HelloService {\n    public String sayHello() {\n        return \"Hello, Spring Boot!\";\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nStep 2: Define Bean in a @Configuration Class\n\n```\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;\n\n@Configuration\npublic class AppConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    public HelloService helloService() {\n        return new HelloService();\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nStep 3: Use the Bean in a Controller\n\n```\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;\n\n@RestController\n@RequestMapping(\"/hello\")\npublic class HelloController {\n\n    private final HelloService helloService;\n\n    public HelloController(HelloService helloService) {\n        this.helloService = helloService;\n    }\n\n    @GetMapping\n    public String sayHello() {\n        return helloService.sayHello();\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n🌟 Expected Output\n\n```\nGET /hello  --> Response: \"Hello, Spring Boot!\"\n\n```\n\n🛠 When to Use @bean?\n\n✅ When you need fine-grained control over bean creation.\n\n✅ When the class does not use @Component, @Service, or @Repository.\n\n✅ When you want to configure third-party libraries (e.g., RestTemplate, DataSource).",

            "content": "HPC-AI Tech researchers introduce Open-Sora 2.0, a commercial-level AI video generation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing training costs. This model was developed with an investment of only $200,000, making it five to ten times more cost-efficient than competing models such as MovieGen and Step-Video-T2V. Open-Sora 2.0 is designed to democratize AI video generation by making high-performance technology accessible to a wider audience. Unlike previous high-cost models, this approach integrates multiple efficiency-driven innovations, including improved data curation, an advanced autoencoder, a novel hybrid transformer framework, and highly optimized training methodologies.\n\n \n\nThe research team implemented a hierarchical data filtering system that refines video datasets into progressively higher-quality subsets, ensuring optimal training efficiency. A significant breakthrough was the introduction of the Video DC-AE autoencoder, which improves video compression while reducing the number of tokens required for representation. The model’s architecture incorporates full attention mechanisms, multi-stream processing, and a hybrid diffusion transformer approach to enhance video quality and motion accuracy. Training efficiency was maximized through a three-stage pipeline: text-to-video learning on low-resolution data, image-to-video adaptation for improved motion dynamics, and high-resolution fine-tuning. This structured approach allows the model to understand complex motion patterns and spatial consistency while maintaining computational efficiency.......\n\n \n\nRead full article here: https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/03/14/hpc-ai-tech-releases-open-sora-2-0-an-open-source-sota-level-video-generation-model-trained-for-just-200k/\n\n \n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09642v1\n\n \n\nGitHub Page: https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-Sora?tab=readme-ov-file\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ocv0dyo4bsoe1.png?width=2813&format=png&auto=webp&s=474a5ecdfe80c5fc625dbce68de9b0d492f79d0e\n\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

            "content": "Cornell Tech and Stanford University researchers introduced **Block Discrete Denoising Diffusion Language Models (BD3-LMs)** to overcome these limitations. This new class of models interpolates between autoregressive and diffusion models by employing a structured approach that supports variable-length generation while maintaining inference efficiency. BD3-LMs use key-value caching and parallel token sampling to reduce computational overhead. The model is designed with specialized training algorithms that minimize gradient variance through customized noise schedules, optimizing performance across diverse language modeling benchmarks.\n\n \n\nBD3-LMs operate by structuring text generation into blocks rather than individual tokens. Unlike traditional autoregressive models, which predict the next token sequentially, BD3-LMs generate a block of tokens simultaneously, significantly improving efficiency. A diffusion-based denoising process within each block ensures high-quality text generation while preserving coherence. The model architecture integrates transformers with a block-causal attention mechanism, allowing each block to condition on previously generated blocks. This approach enhances both contextual relevance and fluency. The training process includes a vectorized implementation that enables parallel computations, reducing training time and resource consumption. Researchers introduced data-driven noise schedules that stabilize training and improve gradient estimation to address the high variance issue in diffusion models.......\n\n \n\nRead full article: https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/03/14/this-ai-paper-introduces-bd3-lms-a-hybrid-approach-combining-autoregressive-and-diffusion-models-for-scalable-and-efficient-text-generation/\n\n \n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09573\n\n \n\nGitHub Page: https://github.com/kuleshov-group/bd3lms\n\n \n\nProject: https://m-arriola.com/bd3lms/\n\n \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/d8g3ugnt1qoe1.gif\n\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

            "content": "Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University & Hugging Face investigate optimizing test-time compute for LLMs by refining how models allocate computational resources during reasoning. Instead of relying solely on outcome-reward RL, they introduce a fine-tuning approach that balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring steady progress toward correct answers. Their method incorporates a dense reward bonus to quantify progress, improving efficiency. Evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms existing methods, enhancing both accuracy and token efficiency. Their findings also suggest that optimizing for progress minimizes computational regret while improving solution discovery without sacrificing accuracy.\n\n \n\nThe problem of optimizing test-time compute is framed as a meta reinforcement learning (meta RL) challenge. The goal is to maximize an LLM’s performance within a given test-time token budget by balancing exploration and exploitation. Instead of solely optimizing for outcomes, the proposed Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MRT) approach minimizes cumulative regret by rewarding progress across sequential episodes. This budget-agnostic strategy allows LLMs to make steady progress regardless of training constraints. By incorporating a reward bonus based on incremental improvements, MRT ensures efficient test-time compute usage, enhancing adaptability and response accuracy within deployment constraints......\n\n \n\nRead full article: https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/03/14/optimizing-test-time-compute-for-llms-a-meta-reinforcement-learning-approach-with-cumulative-regret-minimization/\n\n \n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07572\n\n \n\nCode: https://github.com/CMU-AIRe/MRT\n\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

            "content": "Alibaba Researchers present R1-Omni, an application of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) to an omni-multimodal large language model tailored for emotion recognition. R1-Omni builds on the established HumanOmni framework and applies RLVR to fine-tune the model for handling both video and audio data. The method begins with a cold start phase, where the model is pre-trained using a combined dataset from Explainable Multimodal Emotion Reasoning (EMER) and a manually annotated dataset. This initial training helps the model learn basic reasoning skills before being refined with RLVR. By integrating a rule-based reward mechanism into the training process, R1-Omni is optimized not only for accurate emotion prediction but also for generating clear and interpretable explanations that describe how visual and auditory information interact.\n\n \n\nAt the core of R1-Omni’s design is the integration of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). RLVR replaces the need for subjective human feedback with a verifiable reward function that assesses the model’s output against objective criteria. The reward system is straightforward: if the model’s emotion prediction matches the ground truth, it receives a reward of 1; otherwise, it receives 0. Additionally, a format reward ensures that the output adheres to a specified structure, where the reasoning process is clearly separated from the final prediction by designated tags.......\n\n \n\nRead full article: https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/03/12/alibaba-researchers-introduce-r1-omni-an-application-of-reinforcement-learning-with-verifiable-reward-rlvr-to-an-omni-multimodal-large-language-model/\n\n \n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05379\n\n \n\nGitHub Page: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/R1-Omni\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/apwkz061xdoe1.png?width=1744&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c6287ae45fab81686d25fa556441fa1767d11ee\n\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

First, it masters data distribution using unlabeled data via an unsupervised diffusion model, avoiding the semantic ambiguity common in semi-supervised methods. Second, it implements controllable fine-tuning on text-labeled data without expanding the training dataset. Instead, Text2Data employs a constraint optimization-based learning objective that prevents catastrophic forgetting by keeping model parameters close to their pre-fine-tuning state. This unique framework effectively utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data to maintain fine-grained data distribution while achieving superior controllability. Theoretical validation supports the optimization constraint selection and generalization bounds, with comprehensive experiments across three modalities demonstrating Text2Data’s superior generation quality and controllability compared to baseline methods......\n\n \n\nRead full article: https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/03/09/salesforce-ai-releases-text2data-a-training-framework-for-low-resource-data-generation/\n\n \n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10941\n\n \n\nGithub Page: https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/text2data\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6wlo3jj60tne1.png?width=2022&format=png&auto=webp&s=26dfeddfb0803173652c935a176fb4beaf8624ce\n\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

            "content": "Google researchers introduced Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA), which applies differentiable logic gates to cellular automata. This method successfully replicates the rules of Conway’s Game of Life and generates patterns through learned discrete dynamics. The approach merges Neural Cellular Automata (NCA), which can learn arbitrary behaviors but lack discrete state constraints, with Differentiable Logic Gate Networks, which enable combinatorial logic discovery but have not been tested in recurrent settings. This integration paves the way for learnable, local, and discrete computing, potentially advancing programmable matter. The study explores whether Differentiable Logic CA can learn and generate complex patterns akin to traditional NCAs.\n\n \n\nNCA integrates classical cellular automata with deep learning, enabling self-organization through learnable update rules. Unlike traditional methods, NCA uses gradient descent to discover dynamic interactions while preserving locality and parallelism. A 2D grid of cells evolves via perception (using Sobel filters) and update stages (through neural networks). Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) extend this by replacing neurons with logic gates, allowing discrete operations to be learned via continuous relaxations. DiffLogic CA further integrates these concepts, employing binary-state cells with logic gate-based perception and update mechanisms, forming an adaptable computational system akin to programmable matter architectures like CAM-8........\n\n \n\nRead full article: https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/03/09/google-ai-introduces-differentiable-logic-cellular-automata-difflogic-ca-a-differentiable-logic-approach-to-neural-cellular-automata/\n\n \n\nTechnical details: https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/?hn\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ng575l3t2qne1.png?width=1372&format=png&auto=webp&s=c542d9ba66aca22099bd01c2862a39809002b2e3\n\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

            "content": "Researchers from Microsoft Research Asia, Ubiquant, and Independent have proposed Logic-RL, a rule-based RL framework that acquires reasoning patterns similar to DeepSeek-R1 through training on logic puzzles. It adopts the REINFORCE++ algorithm and reward designs from DeepSeek-R1 for post-training. As training progresses, the model naturally allocates more computational steps to reasoning, expanding from generating hundreds to thousands of tokens, which enables deeper exploration and refinement of thought processes. Using only 5K generated logic puzzles, their 7B model shows cross-domain generalization, improving by 125% on AIME and 38% on AMC against the base model. This suggests that RL-trained reasoning develops abstract problem-solving patterns rather than domain-specific matching.\n\n \n\nThe researchers face challenges with Qwen2.5-Math-7B’s tendency to generate Python code blocks that conflict with formatting requirements. Testing both Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct reveals nearly identical training metrics during RL training, including validation accuracy, response length growth curves, and reward curves. The implementation shows dramatic improvements in reasoning capabilities, with output length increasing from an initial average of 500 tokens to approximately 2000 tokens after just 1000 RL training steps. This enables the emergence of more complex behaviors, such as reflection and exploration of alternative solutions, and these behaviors significantly enhance the model’s ability to handle complex tasks and are closely aligned with the results reported in DeepSeek-R1......\n\n \n\nRead full article: https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/03/08/microsoft-and-ubiquant-researchers-introduce-logic-rl-a-rule-based-reinforcement-learning-framework-that-acquires-r1-like-reasoning-patterns-through-training-on-logic-puzzles/\n\n \n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14768\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b3he1v212mne1.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=831c34ee3c4150e4f926976ec033ac20913ffbb8\n\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

Rather than relying on traditional training data, PAPRIKA leverages synthetic interaction data generated across a diverse set of tasks. These tasks range from classic guessing games like twenty questions to puzzles such as Mastermind and even scenarios simulating customer service interactions. By training on these varied trajectories, the model learns to adjust its behavior based on contextual feedback from its environment—without the need for additional gradient updates. This approach encourages the model to adopt a more flexible, in-context learning strategy that can be applied to a range of new tasks.\n\n \n\nPAPRIKA’s methodology is built on a two-stage fine-tuning process. The first stage involves exposing the LLM to a large set of synthetic trajectories generated using a method called Min‑p sampling, which ensures that the training data is both diverse and coherent. This step allows the model to experience a wide spectrum of interaction strategies, including both successful and less effective decision-making behaviors. The second stage refines the model using a blend of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and a direct preference optimization (DPO) objective.
