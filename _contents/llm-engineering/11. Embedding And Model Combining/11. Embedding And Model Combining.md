# 11. Embedding And Model Combining

## Summary
Embeddings in Large Language Models (LLMs) are high-dimensional vectors that encode semantic contexts and relationships of data tokens, facilitating nuanced comprehension by LLMs. These embeddings can be uni-modal (for single data types like text) or multi-modal (for cross-modal data interpretation, such as combining text and images). The process of combining embeddings and models involves fine-tuning pre-trained models to adapt to specific tasks, leveraging techniques like transfer learning and attention mechanisms to enhance performance and efficiency.

## Key Concepts
- **Embeddings** : Embeddings are continuous vector representations of words or tokens that capture their semantic meanings in a high-dimensional space, allowing LLMs to process discrete tokens.
- **Model Combining** : Model combining involves integrating different models or embedding techniques, such as fine-tuning pre-trained models or using multi-modal embeddings, to enhance the performance and adaptability of LLMs.
