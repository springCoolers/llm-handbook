# Combining Multiple Models (Ensemble) in LLM

## Summary
Combining multiple models, also known as ensemble learning, is a technique used in Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve performance by leveraging the strengths of individual models. This approach involves training multiple models and then combining their outputs to produce a more accurate and robust final prediction. Ensemble methods can help mitigate the weaknesses of single-model approaches, reduce overfitting, and enhance generalization capacity. In the context of LLMs, ensemble learning can harness the diverse capabilities of individual models to achieve superior results.

## Key Concepts
- **Ensemble Learning** : A technique that combines the outputs of multiple models to produce a more accurate and robust final prediction.
- **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)** : A method that involves creating multiple subsets of the original dataset using bootstrap sampling and training a separate model on each subset.
- **Boosting** : A sequential ensemble method where models are trained one after another, each new model focusing on the errors made by the previous models.
- **Stacking** : A method that involves training multiple base models and then using their predictions as inputs to a higher-level meta-model.
- **LLM-Blender** : A simple ensemble learning framework that ranks and merges outputs from various LLMs using pairwise comparison and generative fusion.
